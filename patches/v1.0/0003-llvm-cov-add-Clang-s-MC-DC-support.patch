Subject: [RFC PATCH 3/3] llvm-cov: add Clang's MC/DC support

Add Clang flags and kconfig options for measuring the kernel's modified
condition/decision coverage (MC/DC).

As of Clang 19, users can determine the max number of conditions in a
decision to measure via option LLVM_COV_KERNEL_MCDC_MAX_CONDITIONS,
which controls -fmcdc-max-conditions flag of Clang cc1 [1]. Since MC/DC
implementation utilizes bitmaps to track the execution of test vectors,
more memory is consumed if larger decisions are getting counted. The
maximum value supported by Clang is 32767. According to local
experiments, the working maximum for Linux kernel is 44, with the
largest decisions in kernel codebase (with 45 conditions) excluded,
otherwise the kernel image size limit will be exceeded. The largest
decisions in kernel are contributed for example by macros checking
CPUID.

Code exceeding LLVM_COV_KERNEL_MCDC_MAX_CONDITIONS will produce compiler
warnings.

As of LLVM 19, certain expressions are still not covered, and will produce
build warnings when they are encountered:

"[...] if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean
 expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not
 supported. For example, in x = (a && b && c && func(d && f)), the d && f
 case starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other
 conditions by the operator func(). When this is encountered, a warning
 will be generated and the boolean expression will not be
 instrumented." [2]
