Subject: [PATCH v3 2/4] llvm-cov: add Clang's MC/DC support

Add infrastructure to enable Clang's Modified Condition/Decision Coverage
(MC/DC) [1].

Clang has added MC/DC support as of its 18.1.0 release. MC/DC is a fine-
grained coverage metric required by many automotive and aviation industrial
standards for certifying mission-critical software [2].

In the following example from arch/x86/events/probe.c, llvm-cov gives the
MC/DC measurement for the compound logic decision at line 43.

   43|     12|			if (msr[bit].test && !msr[bit].test(bit, data))
  ------------------
  |---> MC/DC Decision Region (43:8) to (43:50)
  |
  |  Number of Conditions: 2
  |     Condition C1 --> (43:8)
  |     Condition C2 --> (43:25)
  |
  |  Executed MC/DC Test Vectors:
  |
  |     C1, C2    Result
  |  1 { T,  F  = F      }
  |  2 { T,  T  = T      }
  |
  |  C1-Pair: not covered
  |  C2-Pair: covered: (1,2)
  |  MC/DC Coverage for Decision: 50.00%
  |
  ------------------
   44|      5|				continue;

As the results suggest, during the span of measurement, only condition C2
(!msr[bit].test(bit, data)) is covered. That means C2 was evaluated to both
true and false, and in those test vectors C2 affected the decision outcome
independently. Therefore MC/DC for this decision is 1 out of 2 (50.00%).

As of Clang 19, users can determine the max number of conditions in a
decision to measure via option LLVM_COV_KERNEL_MCDC_MAX_CONDITIONS, which
controls -fmcdc-max-conditions flag of Clang cc1 [3]. Since MC/DC
implementation utilizes bitmaps to track the execution of test vectors,
more memory is consumed if larger decisions are getting counted. The
maximum value supported by Clang is 32767. According to local experiments,
the working maximum for Linux kernel is 46, with the largest decisions in
kernel codebase (with 47 conditions, as of v6.11) excluded, otherwise the
kernel image size limit will be exceeded. The largest decisions in kernel
are contributed for example by macros checking CPUID.

Code exceeding LLVM_COV_KERNEL_MCDC_MAX_CONDITIONS will produce compiler
warnings.

As of LLVM 19, certain expressions are still not covered, and will produce
build warnings when they are encountered:

"[...] if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean
 expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not
 supported. For example, in x = (a && b && c && func(d && f)), the d && f
 case starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other
 conditions by the operator func(). When this is encountered, a warning
 will be generated and the boolean expression will not be
 instrumented." [4]
