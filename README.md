## 1. Create an account

### 1.1 If this is your first CloudLab account...

Go to https://www.cloudlab.us/signup.php?pid=linux-mcdc

In the left column, fill in your personal information.

- One step will ask you to upload your SSH pubic key. Only RSA is supported.
  You can add more keys afterwards.

In the right column, nothing has to be changed: "Join Existing Project" should
have been chosen; "linux-mcdc" should have been auto-filled as Project ID.

### 1.2 If you have a CloudLab account before...

WIP

<!-- Go to https://cloudlab.us/.

Log in with you previous account.

In your User Dashboard, click the top-right button with your user name.

Click "Start/Join Project".

Choose "Join Existing Project" and type "linux-mcdc" as Project ID. -->

## 2. Create an experiment

After your account is approved, log in to your User Dashboard, click the
top-left button "Experiments". Click "Start Experiment".

<!-- Experiment means... -->

1. "Select a Profile": Click "Next"
2. "Parameterize":
    - "Select OS image": Select an OS image
    - "Optional physical node type": Select a machine type, e.g. "c6420",
      "c6320", "c8220". Detailed specs of each machine type can be found
      [here](https://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html). Machines are not always
      available, check current availability [here](https://www.cloudlab.us/resinfo.php)
      (login required).
    - You can keep other fields their defaults. Click "Next"
3. "Finalize"
    - "Name": Give your experiment a name. This is recommended as you will have
      a predictable domain name. E.g.

      ```text
      node0.<your name goes here>.linux-mcdc-PG0.clemson.cloudlab.us
            |                     |              |
            experiment name       project name   cluster
                                                 name
      ```

    - "Project" (if asked): Select "linux-mcdc".
    - "Cluster" (if asked): This question appears because your chosen
      machine type is available in multiple clusters. Just select one.
4. "Schedule": Click "Next"

Wait for the experiment to become ready (usually taking a few minutes). Go to
the "List View" tab, and you will find the needed `ssh` command to log in to the
machine. (Or you can use the more predictable domain name described above)

**By default the experiment lasts for only 16 hours.** See "FAQ" for how to
extend it.

## FAQ

- Errors like the below screenshots:

    <details><summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>

    <img src="error1_screenshot.png" alt="error1_screenshot.png">

    <img src="error2_screenshot.png" alt="error2_screenshot.png">

    </details>

    Most likely your selected machine type is not available at the moment.
    Check availability [here](https://www.cloudlab.us/resinfo.php).

- Experiment extension: if your experiment was created no longer than 2 weeks
  ago, you can extend it for another 7 days "for free".

    1. Click the "Extend" button
    2. Choose 7 days. (More than 7 days will need CloudLab staff intervention)
    3. Type in your short explanation
    4. Click the "Request Extension" button

  If your experiment was created more than 2 weeks ago, your extension will need
  approval from CloudLab staff, which is not guaranteed.

- Disks and partitions. For some machine types the rootfs is only allocated a
  small portion of the full disk. You probably want to gain more space. For
  example the following commands can expand `/dev/sda3` as much as possible on
  "c6420", "c6320", "c8220" etc.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install cloud-guest-utils
    sudo growpart /dev/sda 3
    sudo resize2fs /dev/sda3
    ```

- Any project member can access any experiment in this project via key-based
  authentication even if it was not created by themselves. **But the practice of
  this project is everyone works in their own experiment,** to minimize
  interference. Let the other person know before logging in to their machines.
- Wipe all data & config and reset your machine to its initial state:

    1. Go to the "Topology View" tab
    2. Click the icon for you machine (which by default has a name "node0")
    3. Click "Reload"
    4. If you are sure, click "Confirm"

<!-- geni-get command for automation -->
