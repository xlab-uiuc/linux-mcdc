[![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/xlab-uiuc/linux-mcdc/llvm-18.yml?label=LLVM%2018)](https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/linux-mcdc/actions/workflows/llvm-18.yml)

This project demonstrates MC/DC coverage on the 5.15.y Linux kernel source tree
using [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html). Primary
development of the kernel patch set is being performed in the [xlab-uiuc/llvm-cov](https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/linux-cov)
project.

Follow the instructions [here](docs/measure-kernel-mcdc.md) to get started.

We gave an [ELISA](https://elisa.tech/) seminar titled "Making Linux Fly: Towards Certified Linux
Kernel".
